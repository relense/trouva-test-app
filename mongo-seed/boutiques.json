Things that are designed to last, functional and beautiful as well as  a few things are cleverly upcycled or one-off curious vintage finds.\n\nWe have plenty of cookware, from enamel pie tins and colourful ptichers to wooden utensils and cast iron tea pots. There are things for measuring, things for preserving, things for the mycologist, mixologist and forager. Brushes for cooking and cleaning, iron hooks and wooden pegs for hanging things and curious foxy doorknobs. \n\nWe are especially fond of  hand-crafted objects and things made by traditional methods. We are also building up a range of beautiful things designed by local people.  \n\nLike our local larder, the homeware shop is seasonal with things like garden tools, planters & seeds in the spring, picnic, BBQ and outside gear for the summer and in the  winter we  wooly draft excluders, chestnut roasters and lambswool throws.\n\nCornercopia's local larder is just next to  the Homeware store and on the shelves of our small shop you will find jars of  jam made with fruit collected from local gardens and allotments, honey made by South London bees, next to pots of mango and habenero relish and bottles of Brixton Pound sauce made using ingredients sourced in Brixton market.  \nWe also sell some fantastic beers form local micro-breweries and some of the best English spirits and fruit liqueurs.  We have chosen some of the best local products to make some very special hampers full of delicious local products not available elsewhere. These are available on Street-hub to be delivered to your door, or you can come directly to the shop and put together a bespoke hamper.\n\n",

Hand-knitting, crochet, hand-stitching and hand-embroidery are also incorporated into many Lowie garments. Each season a print is designed  in-house, creating an aspect within each collection that is totally unique to the Lowie brand.\n\nFrom label staples like classic tea dresses and soft cashmere berets to highlight pieces such as vintage inspired dresses and delicate mohair lacy knee socks, Lowie is firmly established as a truly unique fashion label. \n\nWorn by fashionistas including Liberty Ross, Erin O'Connor, Lily Cole, Fearne Cotton, Rachel Khoo and fashion-forward individuals like you, each Lowie customer appreciates the time, thought and effort that have gone into each high quality, quirky piece.",

We have a fabulous range of womenswear and childrenswear and a developing selection of menswear as well as products for your home.\n\nSo why Fair Trade? For us at FAIR, it’s a completely different way of doing business that ensures people and the planet get the respect that they deserve. Awareness of the social and environmental costs of “fast fashion” has grown tremendously in the last few years and consumers are increasingly seeking out alternatives. We are here to offer those alternatives and show consumers that there is another way.\n\nSince 2008, FAIR has been nominated for a number of local and national ethical fashion awards. Most recently, FAIR has been nominated in the category of Best Independent Boutique for the Ethical Fashion Forum’s 2012 Source Awards.  This award recognizes best practice in the curation, marketing and sale of sustainable fashion through a multi brand platform."

When I asked my grandmother how they met, she showed me a photo album of a boat trip between Plymouth and Bombay dated 1933, complete with a signed photo of Hemingway kneeling next to his kill on an African plain. It’s an incredible record of a time when travel was seen as a life experience rather than the quickest way from A to B. The album inspired us to create a collection of travel bags and accessories that recapture that spirit of adventurous travel.”"
